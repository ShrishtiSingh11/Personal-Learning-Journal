Here, I will be explaining the concepts I have learned in my own words, how I see , interpret and connect them to real life them.

Understanding OOP in the Easiest Way Possible
1. Introduction

OOP is a concept I’ve been learning for the past two semesters.
It’s relatively easy once you get the idea, but the way it’s taught can make it feel ambiguous and confusing.

This is my attempt to explain it in a way that makes sense to me.

2. What is OOP in one sentence?

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a way to simplify big, messy code by organizing it into objects and classes.

3. The 4 Pillars Explained Like Talking to a Friend

Encapsulation – like keeping your room clean by putting things in drawers. Data + logic stay together.

Inheritance – like getting traits from your parents. A child class can reuse its parent’s features.

Polymorphism – one person, many roles (student, friend, child). Same name, different behavior.

Abstraction – using your phone without knowing its circuits. You see only what you need.

4. One Tiny Code Snippet
class Animal {
    void sound(){
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound(){
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}


This snippet shows inheritance — the class Animal acts as the parent class and Dog inherits from it.

5. Conclusion

This is a fun blog I wanted to write, so it’s analogy-based and not too technical.

I'm looking forward to writing more of these and polishing them as I go.
